# D3 Visualization Workflow Implementation Plan

Based on our discussion, I will create a new workflow to guide D3.js visualization projects. This workflow will focus on the "Data Flow Pipeline" and the practical "Copy-Paste-Refactor" strategy.

## Proposed Changes

### [NEW] [d3-visualization.md](file:///d:/yonggeun/porter/git/fastlab/.agent/workflows/d3-visualization.md)

This new workflow file will contain:
1.  **D3 Visualization Roadmap (The Data Flow Pipeline)**:
    - **Step 0: Data Source Verification**: Validate file loading, data types, and check for missing values using `console.table`.
    - **Step 1: Canvas Setup**: Define margins, `width`, `height`, and inner dimensions.
    - **Step 2: Scale Definition**: Creating mapping functions (e.g., `scaleTime`, `scaleLinear`).
    - **Step 3: Data Binding & SVG Construction**: Appending elements and binding data.
    - **Step 4: Axis Implementation**: Adding ticks, labels, and custom layout adjustments.
    - **Step 5: Framework Adaptation**: Strategies for integrating the static D3 code into frameworks like Astro or Svelte (e.g., using `onMount`, reactive declarations, or componentization).
2.  **Implementation Strategy**:
    - Start from existing templates/galleries.
    - How to handle `d` (data binding) in different contexts.
    - Using "Snippet Recipes" for complex positioning or styling.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- None applicable for a documentation-only workflow.

### Manual Verification
- Review the content of the workflow file to ensure it accurately reflects the 4-step pipeline and the advice provided in our conversation.
- Wait for user approval via `notify_user`.
